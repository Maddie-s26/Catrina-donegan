    <h2 style = "font-weight: 100; padding-bottom: 20px;">Innovation Survey One</h2> 
    <h1><font size ='+5'><B>Catrina Donegan</B></font></h1>
    <ol>
    <li><h4 style="padding-top: 50px;">Do you consent to giving your input on this survey?</h4></li>
    <p style="font-family:courier new;">Yes</p>
    
    <li><h4>Do you have an experienced issue with the the NHS? If so, what was it?</h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
      <li>General practice</li>
        <li>So busy, not enough time and not enough nurses so patient care is deteriorating - it also means that patients often abuse the nurses because waiting times are so long</li>
        <li>Sometimes you don't get appreciated as a nurse by comparison with other nurses, disheartening </li>
        <li>Overworked which makes you anxious which means you can't give your all for the patient</li>
    </ul>

    <li><h4>How do you feel about waiting times at hospitals? </h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
        <li>They're disastrous - far too long</li>
        <li>Pandemic has made it so much worse because there is a huge backlog </li>
        <li>Makes it more stressful for people working and anxiety levels rise between staff members and patients and it sort of spirals downward</li> 
        
      </ul> 

    <li><h4>Are hospital staff overworked? Why/why not?</h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
      <li>Yes definitely, 100% </li>
        <li>Understaffing</li> 
        <li>Not enough staff in all departments</li>
        <li>Lack of appreciation, especially for nurses, means that people feel less inclined to take up nursing - as well with a complete underpayment</li>
        <li>Rising costs of living means that becoming a nurse is quite undesirable - has a massive impact on their family life and mental health</li>
        
      </ul>

    <li><h4>Would a wearable device that monitors health be invasive? Why/ why not</h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
      <li>No, it is a very good idea
        <li>It's done on an individual basis - catering to individual needs</li>
        <li>Private and confidential - know when to go and when not to go and encourage people who wouldn't usually seek medical device to go and seek it if they need it. There are 2 sides to the coin</li>
        
      </ul> 
 
    <li><h4>What's your opinion on your health data being sent to the NHS?</h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
      <li>If its done securely, it's okay
        <li>The system has to be really rigid because there are always blips </li>
        <li>People dealing with the data need to be trained to a high standard to avoid mistakes and what not </li>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <li><h4>What is your overall opinion on the NHS? Why is this?</h4></li></ol>
    <p style="font-family:courier new; padding-left: 65px;">It's by no means perfect, but it is a very good free service for all the patients in this country. There is a lot of room for improvement with it.  </p>
